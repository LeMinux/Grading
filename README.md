# Grading
A script I plan on creating for grading. 

Planned flags are
-dd for going into a directory that has other directories inside of it
-d (default) for specifiying a directory to grade
-di for a dif check on a file

Planned format is
<command> <flags> <answer key>.txt> <grading things>

Planning to use colors green = passed case red = failed case
